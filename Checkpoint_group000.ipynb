    "Connect 4 is a popular 2 player game in which players take turns placing pieces in a 6 X 7 grid board. The objective is for a player to have 4 of their pieces connected in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Our goal is to design an AI that plays a perfect game of Connect 4 every time, regardless of what move the opponent makes, by training our model using reinforced learning in Kaggle's Connect X simulation environment."

    "Currently, there are a lot of AI developments especially in gaming. However, some research has pointed to the fact that there is still a lot of room for further advancements. In our project, we aim to create an AI that would beat the user every time in a game of Connect-4.

    "Changed :Currently, there are a lot of AI developments especially in gaming. However, some research has pointed to the fact that there is still a lot of room for further advancements. In our project thus far, we aim to play Connect 4 against an AI, that use a simulation to find the moves to make winning combinations, and doing so in several trials so that the AI can learn to play better. Additionally, we hope to implement a Q-Learning Algortihm to a player bot and a Monte Carlo algorithm to a second player bot in order to compare their winning success. "
